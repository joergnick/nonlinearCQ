# nonlinearCQ
Project implements a black box CQ solver for nonlinear problems, targeted at scattering problems by making use of the BEM - Library Bempp. The toolbox is capable of solving a general class of evolution equations, assuming vanishing initial conditions (for both the value and its derivatives). 

In particular this gives discretization schemes for fractional evolution equations.
